#### **Assignment 4:**

For this assignment, we worked in groups to collaboratively write a script that can store inputted data in a file.
My team members for this project were Kelsey (kelhammer) and Uriel (HigFig). 

We all
naturally fell into different roles as we began working on this project. I kept my terminal up and took the lead on
typing the script. Kelsey kept track of 
the requirements for completing the assignment, and pulled up notes from previous class sessions as needed for reference.
Uri was in charge of googling ideas for code that we hadn't explicitly discussed in class. When we ran into a problem, we 
all put our minds together to troubleshoot a solution. I feel like it was a very efficient process.

Here is a link to our Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/tfrahm/fred-s-ghost-assignment-4">Fred's Ghost</a> (We chose 
our team name to honor my halloween costume and everyone's favorite deceased Weasley.)

I really enjoyed working with my team members. I think working on a team made the work flow more
smoothly and also helped me learn new ways to approach problems that I may never have discovered on my own.
(For example, Uri taught me a totally different way to add colors to our script than the way I did it 
when I wrote my script for Assignment 3, and Kelsey noticed an error that was preventing our script from running 
correctly that was really throwing us for a loop. Once we fixed that last error and our script ran correctly, we all cheered!
It was great to participate in that moment of shared pride and accomplishment.)

We did face some challenges (i.e. figuring out how to generate a random string of characters or how to append data into 
a file so that it won't overwrite itself each time, as well as being late to class because we were standing in the sun for 
four hours waiting for Obama to make an appearance at the Clinton Rally), but - while we never got to see Obama's speech in person - we did learn 
one important lesson on Wednesday: we're all <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrongerTogether?src=hash">#strongertogether</a>. 

As my team and I collaborated on some legit scripting, Obama presented a script of his own on the other side of campus:
