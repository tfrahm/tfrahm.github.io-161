A mere three weeks ago, coding looked to me a lot like the strings of letters my cat generates when she walks across the keyboard if I haven't paid her enough attention... basically, a jumble of meaningless characters.

(wand waving) - INLS 161: Tools for Information Literacy

While there will be no fire-breathing dragons, flying on broomsticks, or liquid luck (unfortunately for my gradebook), INLS 161 is not without it's "charms."

We've learned a few tricks and treats. For instance, CSS gives us the ability to:

make it PINK! 

or

make it BLUE!

...we've even learned the equivalent of an unforgivable curse or two:

"rm"

Just take a look at this awesome website I created. I put a spell on it... and now it's mine!
