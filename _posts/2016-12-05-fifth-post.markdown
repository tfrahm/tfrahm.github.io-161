#### **Assignment 6:**

a.k.a. THE LAST ASSIGNMENT OF 161

For this assignment, we paired up to create some fancy presentations about things related to information technology.
Jaffa was my partner in crime. We chose accessibility as our topic (by which I mean I chose accessibility as our topic and Jaffa kindly obliged) because it's 
something that I've been learning a lot about lately both in school and at work and I think it's super interesting, and also very relevant
to some of the things we've learned in class (namely, web development & HTML).

I created the master repository and Jaffa created the .md file. From there, we both collaborated on researching the topic and finding cool images, styles, 
and fragments to include in our presentation. We wrote the script together and then recorded our audio files separately. We met several times outside of class
to work on troubleshooting errors (of which there were, of course, A LOT).

We used tons of skills that we've learned in class this semester, like:

* html
* css
* git
* markdown
* pandoc
* scripting

And we learned some new skills too:

* reveal.js
* audacity
* vorbis

This project required a lot of push and pull to get everything synced and working correctly. It was fun collaborating with another person but that 
also made it more difficult to troubleshoot problems. Honestly, there were times we were getting error after error but we just kept using our 
favorite commands (`git status`, `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) until the errors magically disappeared!

**TL;DR:** Don't be like Gandalf...

What inaccessiblity (and also Finals Week) feels like:

Not cool, web developers. Not cool.

I hope to continue learning and developing the skills I gained in this course, both in future classes and in my career. 
I'm studying User Experience, so understanding how web development/the internet works from "behind 
the curtain" will be of great benefit to my understanding of human-computer interaction, and will also
allow me to have intelligent conversations with designers. More practically, I hope to put the skills I've learned to use 
in my position as SCALA Webmaster next year.

Most importantly, git has really upped my pun game.
