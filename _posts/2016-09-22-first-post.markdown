Once upon a time, coding looked to me a lot like the strings of letters my cat generates when she walks across the keyboard if I haven't paid her enough attention... basically, a jumble of meaningless characters. Like parseltongue, it was something that could only be understood by evil wizards who practice the dark arts. 

Fitting, because I'm pretty sure my cat is actually the Heir of Slytherin.

Now, I see coding as a magical language of spells that when spoken, can make anything possible. And thanks to INLS 161, I can be a wizard too!

**INLS 161: Tools for Information Literacy**

While there will be no "foolish wand-waving," in this class - no fire-breathing dragons, flying on broomsticks, or liquid luck either (unfortunately for my gradebook), Info Lit is not without it's "charms."

We've learned a few tricks and treats. For instance, 

{% highlight ruby %}
git commit -m "lets us travel back to this moment in time"
{% endhighlight %}
in a completely non-paradoxical way! (Unlike that silly *Cursed Child* book.)

My therapist is going to be super impressed with my newfound ability to commit.

Plus, CSS gives us the ability to:

<span class="pink">make it **PINK** </span> or <span class="blue">make it <strong>BLUE!</strong></span>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eOYJdq-NJ0s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And with java we can even <span class="spark" font-size="14px">make it sparkle!</span>

Java always *could* make me sparkle. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaffeineAddict?src=hash">#caffeineaddict</a>

But coding isn't all <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp">rainbows</a> and unicorns...

We've also learned an unforgivable curse or two:

{% highlight ruby %}
rm HarryPotter
{% endhighlight %}
^basically the equivalent of Voldemort shouting *AVADA KEDAVRA*!    

Just take a look at this magical website I've created. I cloned it, added some fancy HTML and CSS... <br/>
**AND NOW IT'S MINE!**
