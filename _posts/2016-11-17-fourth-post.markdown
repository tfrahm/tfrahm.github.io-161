#### **Assignment 5:**

For this assignment, my team and I expanded on the script we created for <a href="https://tfrahm.github.io/inls161/2016/11/05/third-post.html">Assignment 4</a>.
Our script asks a series of introductory questions, as one might ask when getting to know someone new. (We have run the script 
so many times in the past few weeks that the names, favorite colors, ages, favorite movies, and haircolors of my teammates are now permanently 
etched into my memory.) The script reads the information, logs the user into MySQL, and stores the data in a nifty little table in a database. In addition to the new functions 
in our script, we also added a README.md file with some instructions for setting up the database and table before running the script
so that everything will (hopefully) come together smoothly.

We learned a lot from this assignment, like:

* how to create databases and tables and add values to them in MySQL
 
* how to generate a random string variable for use as a Primary Key to avoid errors with duplicates
 
* how to change data types in a table when you don't do it right the first time

* that there are, in fact, important differences between MySQL code and SQL code

* that being a coder is a lot like being a librarian in that you basically just Google the shit out of everthing

* that none of us is a very good dancer

This was by far the most challenging assignment yet. There were so many steps involved and so many opportunities for error!
I'm really glad I had Kelsey and Uri by my side - troubleshooting is much faster when you have the power of three brains to work with. 
From the start, conceptualizing what we wanted the script to do was hard for all of us because we don't have a ton of coding experience,
and there were a few times we created trouble for ourselves by making errors that took lots of valuable time to de-mystify.
In the end, there was definitely room for improvement - but I'm super proud of my team. Nothing brings people together like 
shared struggle. 

The accomplishment felt by all of us on Team Fred when we finally managed to get our script to function and our databases 
to sync up was priceless. And thanks to Gif-Master Kelsey, that moment is now forever immortalized:
