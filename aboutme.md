        Once upon a time there was a girl. And God, was she pale. I’m not talking a drop-of-blood-on-freshly-fallen-snow kind of pale, but rather pasty-white-and-blemished, with skin that burned immediately upon exposure to sunlight, and cheeks that flushed red at the most awkward moments.


        To tell you the truth, there was nothing all that spectacular about her. She was no more heir to a king than she was daughter to an abusive sociopathic narcissist. She liked to sing when no one was watching – mostly because she was tone-deaf.
